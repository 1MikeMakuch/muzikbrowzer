Had to use photoshop to create icon with transparent bg that worked.

Create new image with trans bg. Use psp, save as gif with trans bg.

Open it in Adobe PS. PS gets the trans bg, (iconwkshp doesn't with psp saved gif)

Create new image in PS with trans bg.

Select icon from image and paste over transparent bg.
Save as Adobe psd.

Then use iconworkshop to create icons.

Create all icons you want, save 'em into a single ico file.
