<p class=text>

The only time Muzikbrowzer will write to your audio files is if and when
you perform tag editing with Muzikbrowzer Otherwise it only reads tags
for the purpose of building it's database. If you perform tag editing on
your files with software other than Muzikbrowzer, you'll have to rebuild
the Muzikbrowzer database: Menu/MusicLibrary/Rebuild.

<p class=text>

<h3>ID3 tags</h3>
<p class=text>

Reading ID3 tags: Muzikbrowzer first reads the ID3v1 tag, then the ID3v2 tag. If both exist
then the v2 values override v1 values in Muzikbrowzers Library view.
<p class=text>

Writing ID3 tags: If you use Muzikbrowzer to edit your tags it will
write to both the v1 and v2 tag in each file.

<p class=text>
<h3>ID3v1, ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4</h3>

Muzikbrowzer provides full support for ID3v1 and ID3v2.3 tags. 
Muzikbrowzer does <b>not</b> support ID3v2.4 tags.

If you perform tag editing with
Muzikbrowzer on ID3v2.4 tags the v2.4 information will be lost.
Muzikbrowzer will create a ID3v2.3 tag in it's place.

If you are performing tag editing with Muzikbrowzer it attempts to check for
ID3v2.4 tags and present you with a confirmation dialog before converting
to ID3v2.3.  This may or may not be important to you.

<h3>Ogg Vorbis, Flac</h3>
<p class=text>
Reading:  Muzikbrowzer reads GENRE, ARTIST, ALBUM, TITLE, TRACKNUMBER and DATE. If there are
more than one tag field only the last one found is used. For example if a tag contains 2 GENREs only the last one read will be used.
<p class=text>
Writing: Muzikbrowzer supports one tag field per file. So if you have more than one GENRE in a single file and you use Muzikbrowzer to edit the tag in that file, it will be replaced with a single GENRE field in that file.


<h3>Windows Media Format tag (.wma)</h3>
<p class=text>
Reading: Reads WM/Genre, WM/AlbumArtist, WM/AlbumTitle, Title, WM/TrackNumber, WM/Year.
<p class=text>
Writing: Same.
<p class=text>

<h3>Multiple fields of same type</h3>
Muzikbrowzer will only modify the Genre, Artist, Album, Title, Track,
Year tag fields. Any other tag fields
present in your tags will remain unaltered (except for the ID3v2.4 issue
discussed above). Note that if there are multiple tag fields of the same
type in a single tag, and you edit that file with Muzikbrowzer it will
replace those multiple fields with a single field. For example if your
tag has more than one Genre field and you edit it with Muzikbrowzer it
will be replaced with a single Genre field. This applies to all file types.
<p class=text>

<h3>Backup</h3>

Before performing tag editing with any software you should ensure that your
data is backed up. When experimenting with new software you should
first work on copies of a sample of your files. If you use several
different applications to play and manage your files you should make
sure "everything still works" before applying an operation  to your whole
collection.
