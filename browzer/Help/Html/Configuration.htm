				<li>Directories to scan for mp3/ogg files. Tell muzikbrowzer where
				to look for mp3/ogg files on your computer or network.
				<li>Scan. Performs the scan and builds the muzikbrowzer database.
				<li>Location of muzikbrowzer database. Normally the default location is copasetic. This is where muzikbrowzer stores the database, saved playlists, log files etc.
				<li>File extensions. Normally the default "mp3" is sufficient. Only modify this list if you have mp3 files with an extension other than "mp3". If you have ogg files, add "ogg" to this list.
				<li>Run at Startup. This will cause muzikbrowzer to run when you logon. Tip: see the Autolog program at www.sysinternals.com.

<a name="Irman">
			<li>Irman
				<ul class="text">
				<li>Irman COM Port. Choose the serial COM Port you have the
				Irman infrared receiver plugged into. Usually 1 or 2. Choose Disabled if you do not have one.
				<li>Initialize. Click on Initialize after you have chosen a COM Port to test muzikbrowzer communication with the Irman. On Success you should get an "Ok".
				<li>Record. Click Record to teach muzikbrowzer your remote control codes.
					<ul class="text">
					<li>Click Record.
					<li>Click the Up button on the Irman Configuration Dialog.
					<li>Now press the button on your remote control which you choose to serve as the Up button.
					<li>Description. Optional but suggested, enter a brief description of each remote control button. For example if you are using the numeric buttons as the Up/Down/Left/Right buttons you should enter "8" as the description for Up, "2" for Down, etc. These descriptions are displayed when you choose Help via the remote control menu Help button, to help you remember which remote control buttons do what.
					<li>Repeat for all remaining buttons on the dialog.
					</ul>


					<i>Note: Apparently the volume buttons on many remote controls
					operate differently than most of the rest of the remote
					control buttons. Consequently you may find that the
					Irman does not pick up the volume buttons on your remote
					control. If this happens, simply choose another pair of
					buttons to serve as Vol Up/Down.</i>

				<li>Test. When you have finished teaching muzikbrowzer your
				remote control codes click the Test Button.


				<li>IR Pulses per press. You may have to adjust this value depending upon
				how your remote control works with the Irman. This value represents the
				number of ir code sequences transmitted each time you press a button on 
				your remote control. It will vary with different remote controls. 
				
					<ul class="text">
					<li>First "teach" muzikbrowzer your remote control's ir code sequences by
					performing the "Record" procedure above.
					<li>Start with a value of 1 IR Pulses per press.
					<li>Click OK and save the configuration, and return to the muzikbrowzer
					screen.
					<li>Try a few different remote control buttons, up, down, left, right.
					<li>Observe what happens on the muzikbrowzer screen.
					<li>If you for instance you are observing 2 up's, in response to a single press of the up key, then try increasing the 'IR Pulses per press' value to 2.
