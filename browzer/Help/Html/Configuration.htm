				<h1>Settings</h1>
				<p class="text">
				The following refer to the tabs on the Muzikbrowzer Menu/Settings dialog.


				
<a name="General">
			<ul class="text">
			<li><b>General</b>
			<ul class="text">
			<li><b>Audio file folders</b>. Tell Muzikbrowzer where
				to look for audio files on your computer or network. You don't want
				to enter "C:\" here, rather, enter the specific directory(ies) where your
				music files are stored. Also when you Add specific music to the library (from
				Menu/Music Library/Add music) it may appear in this list. Muzikbrowzer sorts
				and condenses this list to the minimal necessary. For example if you enter
				C:\MyMusic and C:\MyMusic\folder1, it will eliminate C:\MyMusic\folder1 since
				that will be found by searching C:\MyMusic.

			<li><b>Deleted files & excluded folders</b>. Files/folders in this list will be
				excluded from the library. When you remove music from the library (right
				click on music and select "Delete from Library" or press Delete key)
				Muzikbrowzer remembers those deletions here and will not re-add them to
				the library upon subsequent Search/Builds. Remove them from this list
				to allow them to be added back to the library. <i>Note this Deleted List 
				is intended to be used sparingly. For example if there are a few folders you
				want to exclude for some reason put them here. If the Deleted List is too large
				it will become cumbersome and performance will suffer when entering this
				settings dialog as well as when performing the Search/Rebuild Library
				process. In a future release this deficiency will be addressed.</i>

			<li><b>Location of Muzikbrowzer database</b>. Normally the default 
				location is copasetic. This is where Muzikbrowzer stores the database, 
				saved playlists, skins, log files etc. If you have some reason to store the
				Muzikbrowzer database and other data in a folder other than the default
				"Program Files\Muzikbrowzer" you may do so. If you change this you'll have to
				copy the skins folder to that location. 
			<li><b>Sort Albums</b> by Date - chronogically by album release date if present in the tag. Otherwise alpabetically.

			<li><b>Hide Genre</b>. Checking this will remove the Genre column from the library.

			<li><b>Run at Startup</b>. This will cause Muzikbrowzer to run when you 
			logon. Tip: see the Autolog program at www.sysinternals.com.

			<li<b>Album sort</b>.   
			Sort albums alphabetically or by release date? If set to alphabetically
			you can type the name of an album and it will be located for you.
			For Date sorting the 1st song in each album is examined. If the Year tag
			is present it will be used to sort the list of Albums chronologically. 

			<li><b>ReplayGain volume leveling</b> 
			If enabled
 Muzikbrowzer will look for ReplayGain tags in your
 audio
			files and adjust the volume accordingly. You
 must use other software
			to analyse your audio
 files and create the ReplayGain tags. See the
			chapter on ReplayGain volume leveling.

			</ul>

			<p>

<a name="Display">
			<li><b>Display</b>
				Muzikbrowzer allows a wide range of display settings to be modified to suit
				your environment. As you experiment making changes to this screen you may
				click Apply to apply the changes to Muzikbrowzer.
				<ul>
				<li><b>Skin</b>. Choose the desired skin.
				<li><b>Restore default skins settings</b>. All Display settings on this screen
				have default settings in the skin definition. Click Restore to revert these
				settings back to the skin default. In doing so you'll lose any changes you've
				made to this screen.
				<li><b>Text and Backgrounds</b>. Set the colors and font parameters for the 5
				text types. As you make changes the Sample window reflects your changes.
				<li><b>3D Shadow</b>. Set the 3D Shadow effect for the Column Headers, Data
				Windows and Status line. Around each of these 3 windows are a 2 pixel wide
				border, broken into 4 colors.<br>
					<table border=0><tr><td>
					<ul>
					<li><font size=2 color=red>Top and Left Outer</font>
					<li><font size=2 color=blue>Top and Left Inner</font>
					<li><font size=2 color=black>Bottom and Right Inner</font>
					<li><font size=2 color=green>Bottom and Right Outer</font>
					</ul>
					</td><td>
					<img src="Display3DShadow.gif"><br>
					</td></tr></table>
					These colors used for illustration. Good choice of colors produce desired
					effect.

				<li><b>Margin</b>. Sets the margin around the outer edge of the whole
				Muzikbrowzer window. On some systems (especially tv screens) when you maximize Muzikbrowzer the edges
				may be lost off the edge of the display. Increasing this value resolves this
				problem.

				</ul>

<a name="RemoteControl">
		<li><b>Remote Control</b>
		<ul class="text">
		<li>Several remote control devices are supported including 
		<a target=_blank href="http://www.evation.com">Irman</a>, 
		<a target=_blank href="http://www.usbuirt.com">USB-UIRT</a>, 
		<a target=_blank href="http://www.home-electro.com/">Tira</a> (coming soon)
			<ul>
			<li>Irman - no extra drivers necessary. Muzikbrowzer communicates directly with Irman.
			<li>USB-UIRT Windows driver required. Download from 
		<a target=_blank href="http://www.usbuirt.com">USB-UIRT</a>.
			<li>Tira Windows driver required. 
			</ul>
			See the <a href="RemoteControl.htm">Remote Control</a> chapter for installation instructions for each of
			the support remote control receiver devices.
			These are univeral infrared receiver devices. The manufacturers claim that they
			will "see" ir signals from most all remote controls. See specific manufacturer
			information for details.
		<li><b>Remote Receiver type</b>. Choose the type of remote control receiver
		you have installed on your pc. 
		<li><b>COM Port</b>.  In the case of a serial device (Irman) choose the COM port it's plugged into.  
		<li><b>Initialize</b>. After you've installed your remote receiver device and installed
		any necessary drivers, click on Initialize. Muzikbrowzer will test the
		configured device.  When a device is successfully configured in Muzikbrowzer there
		will be an "OK" displayed next to the Initialize button and you'll be able to go
		into "Learn" mode and teach Muzikbrowzer your remote control's signal codes.

		<li><b>Learn</b>. Click Learn to teach Muzikbrowzer your remote control codes.
			<ul class="text">
			<li>Click Learn.
			<li>Click the Up button on the Settings/Remote Dialog. 
			<b><i>reading...</i></b> is displayed next to the Up button.
			<li>Now press "Up" on your remote control.
				Upon receiving a signal "Learned" is displayed next to the Up button.
			<li>Description. Optional but suggested, enter a
				brief description of each remote control button. For
				example if you are using the numeric buttons as
				the Up/Down/Left/Right buttons you should enter "8"
				as the description for Up, "2" for Down, etc. These
				descriptions are displayed when you choose Help via
				the remote control menu Help button, to help you
				remember which remote control buttons do what.

			<li>Repeat for all remaining buttons, or the ones you choose to use. Not 
			all are required.
			</ul>


			<i>Note: Apparently the volume buttons on many remote controls
			operate differently than most of the rest of the remote
			control buttons. Consequently you may find that the
			remote receiver device does not pick up the volume buttons on your remote
			control consistently. If this happens, simply choose another pair of
			buttons to serve as Vol Up/Down, or you may choose to leave the
			volume on Muzikbrowzer set to maximum and only use the volume on
			your stereo.</i>

		<li><b>Test</b>. When you have <i>taught</i> Muzikbrowzer some or all of
			your remote control codes click on <b>Test</b> to verify that the remote
			receiver device and Muzikbrowzer
			are correctly reading signals from your remote control and that each
			button learned is distinguished from the others. 
			When you click a remote control button and Muzikbrowzer successfully receives
			the signal from the device, the description is displayed in the <b>Read</b>
			window followed by an increment number. This number indicates how many
			times Muzikbrowzer received that signal. (See Key Suppress below).
			
		<li><b>Key suppress</b>. (milliseconds) Some remote controls send more than
			1 infrared signal when you press a button once.
			This parameter allows Muzikbrowzer to
			ignore the extra signals sent by your remote
			control. Successive signals received within this
			time period will be ignored.

			The Key Suppress value should be as low as possible
			without producing Read increments greater than 1.
