				<ul class="text">
			<li><b>Directories to scan for audio files</b>. Tell muzikbrowzer where
				to look for mp3/ogg files on your computer or network. You don't want
				to enter "C:\" here, rather, enter the specific directory(ies) where your
				music files are stored.

			<li><b>Audio File extensions</b>. Normally the default "mp3" is sufficient. 
				Only modify this list if you have mp3 files with an extension other than 
				"mp3". If you have ogg files, add "ogg" to this list.

			<li><b>Location of muzikbrowzer database</b>. Normally the default 
				location is copasetic. This is where muzikbrowzer stores the database, 
				saved playlists, log files etc. If you have some reason to store the
				muzikbrowzer database and other data in a folder other than the default
				"Program Files\muzikbrowzer" you may do so.

			<li><b>Scan</b>. Performs the scan and builds the muzikbrowzer internal 
				database.  If the database exists it is first deleted then 
				completely rebuilt.

			<li><b>Scan for New Files</b>. Retains the existing database and scans in new
				audio files. Use this when you've added new music files into the 
				directories specified above or, you've added one or more directories 
				to the list of directories to scan. Scan for New is significantly 
				faster than a complete Scan because it
				retains the existing database and only searches for new files.
				Note that if you use id3 tag editing software other than muzikbrowzer, 
				you'll have to perform a complete Scan in order for muzikbrowzer to pickup 
				those changes.

			<li><b>Run at Startup</b>. This will cause muzikbrowzer to run when you 
			logon. Tip: see the Autolog program at www.sysinternals.com.

		<ul class="text">
		<li><b>Irman COM Port</b>. Choose the serial COM Port you have the
			Irman infrared receiver plugged into. Usually 1 or 2. Choose Disabled 
			if you do not have one.
		<li><b>Initialize</b>. Click on Initialize after you have chosen a COM Port 
			to test muzikbrowzer communication with the Irman. On Success you should 
			get an "Ok".
		<li><b>IR Pulses per press</b>. You may have to adjust this value depending upon
			how your remote control works with the Irman. This value represents the
			number of ir code sequences transmitted each time you press a button on 
			your remote control. It will vary with different remote controls. See the
			procedure below for determining this value.
		<li><b>Record</b>. Click Record to teach muzikbrowzer your remote control codes.
			According to <a href="www.evation.com">Irman</a> most all infrared
			remote controls will work with the Irman.
			<ul class="text">
			<li>Click Record.
			<li>Click the Up button on the Irman Configuration Dialog. The <b>Code</b>
			value should indicating <B><I>reading...</i></b>.
			<li>Now press the button on your remote control which you choose to serve 
				as the Up button. Upon receiving a signal the <b>Code</b> value
				should display a sequence of hexidecimal digits corresponding to the
				button pressed.
			<li>Description. Optional but suggested, enter a
				brief description of each remote control button. For
				example if you are using the numeric buttons as
				the Up/Down/Left/Right buttons you should enter "8"
				as the description for Up, "2" for Down, etc. These
				descriptions are displayed when you choose Help via
				the remote control menu Help button, to help you
				remember which remote control buttons do what.

			<li>Repeat for all remaining buttons on the dialog.
			</ul>


			<i>Note: Apparently the volume buttons on many remote controls
			operate differently than most of the rest of the remote
			control buttons. Consequently you may find that the
			Irman does not pick up the volume buttons on your remote
			control consistently. If this happens, simply choose another pair of
			buttons to serve as Vol Up/Down, or you may choose to leave the
			volume on muzikbrowzer set to maximum and only use the volume on
			your stereo.</i>

		<li><b>Test</b>. When you have <i>taught</i> muzikbrowzer some or all of
			your remote control codes click on <b>Test</b> to verify that the Irman
			is correctly reading signals from your remote control and that each
			button learned is distinguished from the others. In some cases more than
			one button on a remote control results in the Irman producing the same
			hexidecimal sequence. In this case you may not be able to use those
			buttons or in the worst case you may have to try a different remote control.
				
		<li><b>Ir Pulses per press</b>
		<ul class="text">
		<li>First "teach" muzikbrowzer your remote control's ir code sequences by
		performing the "Record" procedure above.
		<li>Start with a value of 1 IR Pulses per press.
		<li>Click OK and save the configuration, and return to the muzikbrowzer
		screen.
		<li>Try a few different remote control buttons, up, down, left, right.
		<li>Observe what happens on the muzikbrowzer screen.
		<li>If you for instance you are observing 2 up's, in response to a single press of the up key, then try increasing the 'IR Pulses per press' value to 2.
