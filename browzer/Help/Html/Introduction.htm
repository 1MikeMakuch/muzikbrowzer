Welcome to muzikbrowzer. This brief help document
will tell you everything you need to know to begin
playing music from your music collection.
Currently muzikbrowzer plays mp3 and ogg files. Ogg files require an additional
component - see Help Configuration.
<p class="text">

muzikbrowzer is designed to revolutionize the way you play music from
your home entertainment center, from the comfort of your easy chair. With
muzikbrowzer you can now quickly browse  through your entire music 
library and begin playing music with just a few button presses on your
remote control.

<h2>What's new in version 1.3.3?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="text">
muzikbrowzer is now free software and protected by the GPL
</ul>
<h2>What's new in version 1.3.1?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="text">
<b>all Artists</b> Now an entry for <b>all</b> artists appears which displays
all albums for all artists in the Album window. Requested by users.

<li><p class="text">
<b>folder.jpg</b> Now looks for album cover art picture in a file called folder.jpg
in the folder where the audio file resides. This follows Windows XP convention.
Requested by users.

<li><p class="text">
<b>left/right arrow keys</b> now navigate to the previous/next windows. 
Previously left/right arrows were used to re-order songs in the playlist. Now use
the letter keys "u" and "d" to re-order songs in the playlist. Requested by users.

<li><p class="text">
<b>Scan for new files</b> New option in Configuration. This button scans for new audio
files, retaining your existing database. It can be much faster than doing a complete
Scan when you have a large number of audio files.
</ul>

<h2>What's new in version 1.3?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="text">
<b>Album cover art!</b>

muzikbrowzer now displays album cover art. If an APIC field exists in the id3 tag
of your mp3 file(s) muzikbrowzer will display it. It does not attempt to locate
nor retrieve album art.
<li>
<p class="text">
<b>Genre names</b>
In previous versions muzikbrowzer forced all genre names to all lower case. This
restriction is removed.
</ul>
