<ul class="text">
<li>Remote Control
	<ul class="text">
	<li><i>Up/Down/Left/Right</i> navigate between Genres, Artists, Songs, Playlist
	<li><i>Select</i> selects the highlighted Genre, Artist, Album or Song and adds
		it to the Playlist. The first song begins playing.
	<li><i>Menu</i> brings up a menu of choices available with the remote control. These are functionally equivalent to the corresponding functions  accessed by mouse clicking on the Menu button except for <i>Help</i>. <i>Help</i> displays a reference chart showing which remote control buttons perform what functions. This relies upon the Configuration settings you have entered in the Irman tab of the Configuration Dialog. When you choose <i>Save Playlist</i> with the remote control, the playlist is automatically named with the date/time. Note that you can rename it later by Loading and resaving it with the Keyboard/Mouse since that way lets you explicitly name the playlist.

	<li><i>Exit</i> generally exits from subwindows. For example it will exit from
	the Menu opened by pressing <i>Menu</i>
	<li><i>Delete</i> will remove the selected song from the Playlist.
	<li><i>VolUp/Down</i> are not used at this time.
	<li><i>Page Up/Down</i> scroll a page up or down in the Genres, Artists, Albums, Songs or Playlist windows.
	<li><i>Play</i> begins playing the current song in the Playlist, i.e.
	after pressing <i>Pause</i>.
	<li><i>Pause</i> pauses play.
	<li><i>Stop</i> stops play.
	<li><i>Next</i> advances to the next song in the Playlist.
	<li><i>Previous</i> moves to the previous song in the Playlist.
	</ul>
<a name="KeyboardMouse">

	<li>Tab, arrows, page up/down and mouse operate in usual Windows fashion. Tab/Shift Tabadvance to the next/previous window. Arrow keys and page up/down scroll up/down within the current window.
	<li>Left/Right arrows have a special function inside the Playlist. They allow you to reorder the songs in the Playlist. To do so first select a song in the Playlist you wish to move up or down. Then use the left or right arrow key to move the selected song up or down in the Playlist.
	<li>Delete key will delete a song in the Playlist. It has no function in the other windows.
	<li>Right click on any Genre, Artist, Album or Song to access and optionally edit ID3/Ogg tag information. <i>Note: Any saved playlists that you have may become unusable after performing ID3/Ogg tag editing.</i>
	<li>Menu. Click on the Menu button in the upper right corner of muzikbrowzer to access the menu of the following functions:
		<ul class="text">
		<li>Shuffle Playlist. "Shuffles" the Playlist in Artist/Album order. Takes the first song from each Album and adds them to the Playlist, then the second song from each Album and so forth. Successive shuffles on the same Playlist will always yield the same shuffled Playlist.
		<li>Randomize Playlist. Scrambles up the Playlist in random order. Successively randomizing the Playlist will yield a different Playlist each time.
		<li>Clear Playlist. Deletes all songs from the Playlist.
		<li>Save Playlist. Allows you to save your Playlist for later use. 
		<li>Load Playlist. Opens the LoadPlaylist Dialog allowing you to choose from your previously saved playlists. You can also delete a previously saved playlist from here.
		<li>Pause, Play, Stop do the obvious.
		<li>Help. You are here.
		<li>Configuration. See <a href="Html/Configuration.htm" target="_blank">Configuration</a>
		</ul>
	<li>Progress slider. You can use the mouse to fast forward or rewind the song currently playing.
	<li>Minimize, Maximize and Exit buttons appear at the upper right.
	<li>The muzikbrowzer dialog can be resized with the mouse. Size and position are saved and restored next time muzikbrowzer is opened.
	</ul>
<a name="Miscellaneous">
<li>Miscellaneous
	<ul class="text">
	<li>Genres and Artists are sorted alphabetically.
	<li>Albums are sorted by Year if the ID3/Ogg tag contains the year. Otherwise alphabetically.
	<li>Songs are sorted by track number if the ID3/Ogg tag contains the track number. Otherwise by filename (this can be usefull if you don't have the track number in the ID3/Ogg tag but your song files are named with the track number as a prefix, i.e. '01-Here Comes The Sun', '02-Hey Jude', etc).
	<li>Currently muzikbrowzer does not "rip" or record from CD's into mp3 files.
	<li>Certain operations write error and informational messages into the log file, muzikbrowzer.log located in the directory specified in the Configuration dialog. This file may be helpfull in diagnosing problems.
	<li>While playing music muzikbrowzer will display the song currently playing in the Playing status field at the bottom right. As you navigate around through different windows, the currently selected field will temporarily be displayed in this status field. After a few seconds the status field will go back to displaying the song currently playing.
	<li>Album cover art is displayed for the song currently playing and while you are 
	browsing through your mp3 library. Album cover picture is read from the id3 tag of mp3 files if present in an APIC id3 field. Each picture is displayed as you browse through different artists, albums in muzikbrowzer. As well the album cover picture will be displayed as songs are played in muzikbrowzer. Note that you must obtain the album cover picture via software other than muzikbrowzer. 
	<li>The Player Status field is the smaller field to the left of the Playing Status field. It shows the current status of the player, i.e. Playing, Paused etc.
	<li>Screen savers: muzikbrowzer attempts to wakeup your screen saver in response to pressing a remote control button, just as if you have pressed a keyboard key or moved the mouse.
	<li>If muzikbrowzer is minimized, it will maximize itself when a remote control button is pressed.
	<li>Playlist and Song duration: 
	When you queue up songs into the Playlist, muzikbrowzer adds up the duration of each
	song selected and displays the total Playlist duration above the Playlist. 
	To determine the duration of each song muzikbrowzer performs the following steps;
	<ul>
	<li>For ogg files, it just reads the duration from the ogg file
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li>For mp3 files when muzikbrowzer scans each mp3 file (when you click Scan in the Configuration 
	dialog) it looks for the TLEN field in the id3 tag in the mp3/ogg file. The TLEN field may
	be set by some external program you used when you ripped, or recorded, the song. Or 
	it may be set by some other software you use. 
	If the TLEN field is present muzikbrowzer uses this value as the songs duration time.

	<li>If the TLEN field is not present in the id3 tag for an mp3 file then muzikbrowzer
	attempts to quickly analyze the mp3 file, looking for mp3 headers which provide 
	duration information. 
	If
	muzikbrowzer can quickly determine the songs duration it will use this value. In this case 
	muzikbrowzer will store the song duration in it's own internal database and use it for 
	the Playlist duration display.
	If muzikbrowzer cannot  quickly
	determine the song duration it will not be represented in the Playlist duration
	field the first time the song is played in muzikbrowzer. 
	
	However, after the song is played the first time
	muzikbrowzer will recognize how long the song took to play and it will store the song's duration in it's internal 
	database for later use.
