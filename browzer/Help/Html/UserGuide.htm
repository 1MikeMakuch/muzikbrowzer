Note: words appearing in <i>italics</i> represent the remote control button
associated with that function. <p class="text">
<a name="Remote">
<ul class="text">
<li>Remote Control
	<ul class="text">
	<li><i>Up/Down/Left/Right</i> navigate between Genres, Artists, Songs, Playlist
	<li><i>Select</i> selects the highlighted Genre, Artist, Album or Song and adds
		it to the Playlist. The first song begins playing.
	<li><i>Menu</i> brings up a menu of choices available with the remote control. These are functionally equivalent to the corresponding functions  accessed by mouse clicking on the Menu button except for <i>Help</i>. <i>Help</i> displays a reference chart showing which remote control buttons perform what functions. This relies upon the Configuration settings you have entered in the Irman tab of the Configuration Dialog. When you choose <i>Save Playlist</i> with the remote control, the playlist is automatically named with the date/time. Note that you can rename it later by Loading and resaving it with the Keyboard/Mouse since that way lets you explicitly name the playlist.

	<li><i>Exit</i> generally exits from subwindows. For example it will exit from
	the Menu opened by pressing <i>Menu</i>
	<li><i>Delete</i> will remove the selected song from the Playlist.
	<li><i>VolUp/Down</i> are not used at this time.
	<li><i>Page Up/Down</i> scroll a page up or down in the Genres, Artists, Albums, Songs or Playlist windows.
	<li><i>Alpha Up/Down</i> jumps to the next letter in the alphabet within the Genres, Artists, Albums or Songs windows. This can be faster than Page Up/Down when you have a very long list of Artists or Albums to navigate through.

	<li><i>Play</i> begins playing the current song in the Playlist, i.e.
	after pressing <i>Pause</i>.
	<li><i>Pause</i> pauses play.
	<li><i>Stop</i> stops play.
	<li><i>Next</i> advances to the next song in the Playlist.
	<li><i>Previous</i> moves to the previous song in the Playlist.
	</ul>
<a name="KeyboardMouse">
<li>Keyboard/Mouse
	<ul class="text">

	<li>Tab, arrows, page up/down and mouse operate in usual Windows
	fashion. Tab/Shift and left/right arrows advance to the next/previous window. Arrow
	keys and page up/down scroll up/down within the current window.

	<li>Pressing an alpha letter key will jump you to that position in the Genre, Artist,
	Album window. For instance if you press 'Y' it'll take you to the Y's in your Genre,
	Artist or Album window.

	<li>The Alt+Up/Alt+Down arrow keys have a special function inside the Playlist. They
	allow you to reorder the songs in the Playlist. To do so first select a
	song in the Playlist you wish to move up or down. Then use the Alt+Up or
	Alt+Down to move the selected song up or down in the Playlist.

	<li>Delete key will delete a song in the Playlist. It has no function in the other windows.
	<li>Right click on any Genre, Artist, Album or Song to access and optionally edit tag information. <i>Note: Any saved playlists that you have may become unusable after performing tag editing.</i>
	<li>Menu. Click on the Menu button in the upper right corner of muzikbrowzer to access the menu of the following functions:
		<ul class="text">
		<li>Shuffle Playlist. "Shuffles" the Playlist in Artist/Album order. Takes the first song from each Album and adds them to the Playlist, then the second song from each Album and so forth. Successive shuffles on the same Playlist will always yield the same shuffled Playlist.
		<li>Randomize Playlist. Scrambles up the Playlist in random order. Successively randomizing the Playlist will yield a different Playlist each time.
		<li>Clear Playlist. Deletes all songs from the Playlist.
		<li>Save Playlist. Allows you to save your Playlist for later use. 
		<li>Load Playlist. Opens the LoadPlaylist Dialog allowing you to choose from your previously saved playlists. You can also delete a previously saved playlist from here.
		<li>Pause, Play, Stop do the obvious.
		<li>Help. You are here.
		<li>Configuration. See <a href="Html/Configuration.htm" >Configuration</a>
		</ul>
	<li>Progress slider. You can use the mouse to fast forward or rewind the song currently playing.
	<li>Minimize, Maximize and Exit buttons appear at the upper right.
	<li>The muzikbrowzer dialog can be resized with the mouse. Size and position are saved and restored next time muzikbrowzer is opened.
	<li>The Library columns can be adjusted by dragging with the mouse.
	</ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts

<a name="Miscellaneous">
<li>Miscellaneous
	<ul class="text">
	<li>Genres and Artists are sorted alphabetically.
	<li>Albums are sorted by Year if the tag contains the year. Otherwise alphabetically.
	<li>Songs are sorted by track number if the tag contains the track number. Otherwise by filename (this can be usefull if you don't have the track number in the tag but your song files are named with the track number as a prefix, i.e. '01-Here Comes The Sun', '02-Hey Jude', etc).
	<li>Currently muzikbrowzer does not "rip" or record from CD's into mp3 files.
	<li>Certain operations write error and informational messages into the log file, muzikbrowzer.log located in the directory specified in the Configuration dialog. This file may be helpfull in diagnosing problems.
	<li>While playing music muzikbrowzer will display the song currently playing in the Playing status field at the bottom right. As you navigate around through different windows, the currently selected field will temporarily be displayed in this status field. After a few seconds the status field will go back to displaying the song currently playing.

	<li>Album cover art is displayed for the song currently playing
	and while you are browsing through your music library. Album cover
	picture is read from the tag of audio files if present.
	Each picture is displayed as you browse through different
	artists, albums in muzikbrowzer. As well the album cover picture will
	be displayed as songs are played in muzikbrowzer. Note that you must
	obtain the album cover picture via software other than muzikbrowzer.
	If no album art picture is found in the tag muzikbrowzer
	will look in the folder of the audio file for a file called "folder.jpg" or "cover.jpg". This follows
	Windows XP convention.

	<li>The Player Status field is the smaller field to the left of the Playing Status field. It shows the current status of the player, i.e. Playing, Paused etc.
	<li>Screen savers: muzikbrowzer attempts to wakeup your screen saver in response to pressing a remote control button, just as if you have pressed a keyboard key or moved the mouse.
	<li>If muzikbrowzer is minimized, it will maximize itself when a remote control button is pressed.
	<li>Playlist and Song duration: 
	When you queue up songs into the Playlist, muzikbrowzer adds up the duration of each
	song selected and displays the total Playlist duration above the Playlist.
