Note: words appearing in <i>italics</i> represent the remote control button
associated with that function. <p class="text">
<a name="Remote">
<ul class="text">
<li>Remote Control
	<ul class="text">
	<li><i>Up/Down/Left/Right</i> navigate between Genres, Artists, Songs, Playlist
	<li><i>Select</i> selects the highlighted Genre, Artist, Album or Song and adds
		it to the Playlist. The first song begins playing.
	<li><i>Menu</i> brings up a menu of choices available with the remote control. These are functionally equivalent to the corresponding functions  accessed by mouse clicking on the Menu button except for <i>Help</i>. <i>Help</i> displays a reference chart showing which remote control buttons perform what functions. This relies upon the  Settings you have entered in the Remote tab of the Settings dialog. When you choose <i>Save Playlist</i> with the remote control, the playlist is automatically named with the date/time. Note that you can rename it later in the Playlist editor.

	<li><i>Exit</i> generally exits from subwindows. For example it will exit from
	the Menu opened by pressing <i>Menu</i>
	<li><i>Delete</i> will remove the selected song from the Playlist.
	<li><i>VolUp/Down</i> are not used at this time.
	<li><i>Page Up/Down</i> scroll a page up or down in the Genres, Artists, Albums, Songs or Playlist windows.
	<li><i>Alpha Up/Down</i> jumps to the next letter in the alphabet within the Genres, Artists, Albums or Songs windows. This can be faster than Page Up/Down when you have a very long list of Artists or Albums to navigate through.

	<li><i>Play</i> begins playing the current song in the Playlist, i.e.
	after pressing <i>Pause</i>.
	<li><i>Pause</i> pauses play.
	<li><i>Stop</i> stops play.
	<li><i>Next</i> advances to the next song in the Playlist.
	<li><i>Previous</i> moves to the previous song in the Playlist.
	</ul>
<a name="KeyboardMouse">
<li>Keyboard/Mouse
	<ul class="text">

	<li>Tab, arrows, page up/down and mouse operate in usual Windows
	fashion. Tab/Shift and left/right arrows advance to the next/previous window. Arrow
	keys and page up/down scroll up/down within the current window.

	<li>Typing an alphabetical character key will jump you to that position in the Genre, Artist,
	Album window. For instance if you press 'Y' it'll take you to the Y's in your Genre,
	Artist or Album window. Continue typing the name of a Genre or Artist and it will
	automatically locate the word typed. If you are sorting Albums alphabetically (see Settings/General/Album Sort) it works there too. Songs are sorted by track # and this feature doesn't work in Songs.

	<li>The Alt+Up/Alt+Down arrow keys have a special function inside the Playlist. They
	allow you to reorder the songs in the Playlist. To do so first select a
	song in the Playlist you wish to move up or down. Then use the Alt+Up or
	Alt+Down to move the selected song up or down in the Playlist.

	<li>Delete key will delete a song in the Playlist/Library. 
	<li>Right click on any Genre, Artist, Album or Song to access and optionally edit tag information. 
	<li>Menu. Click on the Menu button in the upper left corner of Muzikbrowzer to access the menu of the following functions:

		<ul class="text">
		<li>Open. Muzikbrowzer will open and begin playing any audio file on your disk.
		<li>Music Library functions:
			<ul>
			<li>Add music. Add specific files/folders to your Muzikbrowzer library.
			<li>Search for new/modified music: Searches
				folders (specified in Settings/General) for music
				not currently in the library and adds it. Also
				finds files that have been modified and re-adds
				them to the Library, for instance if you do tag
				editing with other software this is a quicker
				way to get Muzikbrowzer in-sync.
			<li>Complete rebuild: Searches folders (specified
				in Settings/General) for music and rebuilds
				library from scratch.
			<li>Export tags: Export audio file tags into a
				.csv file, importable into spreadsheet program.

			</ul
		<li>Skin: choose desired skin. For info on creating your own skin email <a href="support@muzikbrowzer.com">support@muzikbrowzer.com</a>
		<li>Player:
			<ul>
			<li>Clear Playlist. Deletes all songs from the Playlist
			<li>Fast Forward: Advances in current song
			<li>Load Playlist. Opens the LoadPlaylist Dialog allowing you to choose from your previously saved playlists. 
			<li>Next song, in playlist.
			<li>Pause, Play, Stop do the obvious.
			<li>Play. 
			<li>Previous song, in playlist.
			<li>Randomize Playlist. Scrambles up the Playlist in random order. Successively randomizing the Playlist will yield a different Playlist each time.
			<li>Save Playlist. Allows you to save your Playlist for later use. Saves the playlists in industry standard .m3u format. These may be importable into other devices/software.
			<li>Shuffle, the  playlist. "Shuffles" the Playlist in Artist/Album order. Takes the first song from each Album and adds them to the Playlist, then the second song from each Album and so forth. Successive shuffles on the same Playlist will always yield the same shuffled Playlist.
			<li>Stop
			<li>Reverse, skips backwards in current song playing.
			<li>Volume up/down.
			</ul>
			Each of the above player functions has Alt-key keyboard shortcuts.
		<li>Playlist editor. Allows you to modify/delete playlists.

	If you're using a keyboard emulator type of remote control device, use tab instead of right arrow. Tab will always advance to the next control where as right arrow sometimes does not.
	</p>

<a name="TagEdit">
<li>Tag Editing.<br>
	<ul><li>Access the tag editor by right-clicking in any library column. If you right-click on a Genre you can rename that Genre. If you right click on an Artist you can rename that artist or the genre, etc. Right clicking on "all" in the Album column allows you to change the artist and/or genre for all the albums displayed, enabling simple and powerful cleanup of tag data.
	<li>
	Tag editing is a two step process. First by right clicking on a particular library item you're choosing "search" criteria. If "all" is chosen then the "all" will act as a wildcard during the search.
	<li>Edit the data fields on the right side of the Tag editor dialog to reflect the changes you wish to make. Click Next.
	<li>A search is performed and you are presented with the list of files matching the search criteria. At this point either confirm or cancel.
	<li>Muzikbrowzers database periodically performs a <i>garbage collection</i>, once every 500 file edits performed. This process will take a few minutes to complete. When it occurs a dialog will indicate it's progress. I intend to eliminate this annoyance in a future release.

	</ul>
<a name="Miscellaneous">
<li>Miscellaneous
	<ul class="text">
	<li>Genres and Artists are sorted alphabetically.
	<li>Albums are sorted by Year if the tag contains the year, or alphabetically.
	This behavior can be selected in the Settings/General tab.
	<li>Songs are sorted by track number if the tag contains the track number. Otherwise by filename (this can be usefull if you don't have the track number in the tag but your song files are named with the track number as a prefix, i.e. '01-Here Comes The Sun', '02-Hey Jude', etc).
	<li>Currently Muzikbrowzer does not "rip" or record from CD's into mp3 files.
	<li>Certain operations write error and informational messages into the log file, Muzikbrowzer.log located in the directory specified in the Settings dialog. This file may be helpfull in diagnosing problems.
	<li>While playing music Muzikbrowzer will display the song currently playing in the Playing status field at the bottom right. As you navigate around through different windows, the currently selected field will temporarily be displayed in this status field. After a few seconds the status field will go back to displaying the song currently playing.

	<li>Album cover art is displayed for the song currently playing
	and while you are browsing through your music library. Album cover
	picture is read from the tag of audio files if present.
	Each picture is displayed as you browse through different
	artists, albums in Muzikbrowzer. As well the album cover picture will
	be displayed as songs are played in Muzikbrowzer. Note that you must
	obtain the album cover picture via software other than Muzikbrowzer.
	If no album art picture is found in the tag Muzikbrowzer
	will look in the folder of the audio file for a file called "folder.jpg" or "cover.jpg" 
	This follows Windows XP convention.
	And lastly [AlbumName].jpg following MediaMonkey convention.

	<li>Screen savers: Muzikbrowzer attempts to wakeup your screen saver in response to pressing a remote control button, just as if you have pressed a keyboard key or moved the mouse.
	<li>If Muzikbrowzer is minimized, it will maximize itself when a remote control button is pressed.
	<li>Playlist and Song duration: 
	When you queue up songs into the Playlist, Muzikbrowzer adds up the duration of each
	song selected and displays the total Playlist duration above the Playlist. 
	<li>Extra tag info will be displayed for a song when it is playing. It will appear in
	the Currently Playing status line at the bottom. The following will be displayed if
	present in the audio tag;
		<ul>
		<li>Mp3 file: COMM (Description) 
		<li>Wma file: Description, 
		<li>Ogg file: Description(s), Comment(s)
		<li>Flac file: Description(s), Comment(s)
		</ul>

	<li>Update notification. Upon starting Muzikbrowzer it checks to see if it has
	"phoned home" in the past month. If not it checks in with www.muzikbrowzer.com to see
	if a software update is available. If so it will let you know. 
	</ul>
