<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p class="text">
	<ul class="text">
	<li>muzikbrowzer has been tested on Windows XP, NT and 2000.
	<li>Any PC capable of running the above operating systems will run muzikbrowzer just fine.
	<li>Irman from 
	<a href="http://www.evation.com" target="_blank">www.evation.com</a>. 
	You need this infrared receiver to realize the full benefit of muzikbrowzer. At time of this writing they are selling for about $35.00.
	<li>Remote control: According to 
	<a href="http://www.evation.com" target="_blank">www.evation.com</a>
	virtually all remote controls are compatible with the Irman. See
	<a href="http://www.evation.com" target="_blank">www.evation.com</a> for further information.
	</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p class="text">
	<ul class="text">
	<li>Though it will run on a desktop pc just fine, muzikbrowzer
	shines brightest when it's installed and running in your entertainment 
	center. MusikBrowzer is designed with this as it's primary design goal.
	<li>A number of features and functionality fall out of this requirement:
		<ul class="text">
		<li>Remote Control operability. All necessary playing functions are
		available via remote control. Use of the Irman receiver allows 
		virtually any remote control to be used.

		<li>Ease of use. A second design goal was that it be "as
		easy to  play music with muzikbrowzer as it was with an
		'ole cd player". If you're used to having a cd carousel
		or even a jukebox then you're used to being able to "walk
		up to your stereo and press the play button" and begin
		hearing music. That simple. I designed muzikbrowzer
		to get as close to <i>that</i> level of easyness as
		practically as possible.

		<li>Adjustable Font Size. Accomodates for the relatively
		poor resolution of TVs.
		</ul>

	<li>The suggested configuration is to dedicate a pc  for your
	entertainment center. Use  the TV as the pc's monitor. You'll
	need an appropriate video card  or other hardware to accomplish
	this. Alternatively, there are hardware devices emerging on
	the market which would allow the pc to reside remotely from the
	entertainment center, perhaps even allowing you to use your home desktop
	pc. <a href="http://www.ati.com" target="_blank">ATI Technologies Inc</a> makes a line
	of video cards that allow you to use your TV as a monitor. There are many others available.
		<ul class="text">
		<li>If you are dedicating a pc for your entertainment center you'll 
		likely want to have Internet connectivity as well. You may find it
		usefull to be able to pull up a web page without leaving your easy
		chair.
		<li>Another use of your "entertainment pc" would be to show a slide
		show of pictures from your recent family vacation, taken with your
		new digital camera. Great way to share those photos which you previously
		weren't able to do. Have muzikbrowzer playing some favorite tunes while running some other photo slideshow software!
		</ul>

	<li>Most standard audio cards have a "line out" jack so that
	you can plug it directly into an "audio in" jack on your audio
	receiver. If  you're into more fidelity then choose a higher
	grade audio card with  digital output. <br>

	<center>
	<br><br>
	<img src="configuration.jpg"><br>

	TV serves as the pc monitor.  Audio card's audio <br>
	out jack plugs into audio input on your stereo receiver.<br><br>

	</center>
	<li>So that your "entertainment pc" will always be ready to go 
	there are two suggestions:
		<ul class="text">
		<li>Choose the "Run at Starup" option in muzikbrowzers Configuration/Files dialog. This will cause muzikbrowzer to run each time the pc is booted
		up and you login. And second...
		<li>You might try using the Auto Login program from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com" target="_blank">www.sysinternals.com</a>. This program causes Windows 
		to automatically log you in when it boots up, and avoids you having to use the keyboard.
		</ul>
	<li>Depending upon your entertainment center environment, you may wish to
	purchase a wireless keyboard/mouse. <a href="http://www.interlinkelec.com" target="_blank">Interlink Electronics</a> makes one.
	<li>Remote Control. A remote control which has up/down/left/right buttons works very well. Short of that one with a numeric keypad should work well also, i.e. 2 up, 8 down, 4 left, 6 right.
	</ul>
