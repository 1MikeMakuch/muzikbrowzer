				<h1>Remote Control operation</h1>
				<p class="text">
Depending upon your application there are numerous remote control solutions
from which to choose.<p class=text>

For direct control of Muzikbrowzer with a remote control you must purchase
and install one of the supported IR devices, discussed below.
<p class=text>

A more general solution are the <i>keyboard/mouse emulator</i> programs/devices. These
general purpose products generate virtual keystrokes and allow you to control your pc
with a remote control. Muzikbrowzer supports these products by virtue of the
keyboard shortcuts defined for all functions. 
<p class=text>

Another option is a wireless keyboard/mouse.<p class=text>

Many pc network remote control solutions exist. There are many "pc remote" control
solutions that allow you to remotely control a pc from another pc. Products
like PC Anywhere. 
<p class=text>

<h3>Supported IR devices</h3>
These IR devices are directly supported by Muzikbrowzer.<p class=text>

<ul class=text>
<li><a target=_blank href="http://www.evation.com">Irman</a>
<li><a target=_blank href="http://www.usbuirt.com">USB-UIRT</a>
<li><a target=_blank href="http://www.home-electro.com/">Tira</a> (coming soon)
</ul>
<p class=text>
Each of these devices retails for under $50 and are "universal" infra red
receiving devices. Meaning that they generally will work with any IR remote
control. They do not come with a remote control. The idea is you use one of your
own, perhaps an old one not being used.<p class=text>

<b>Irman</b>. Requires a serial port (not usb). Just plug it into your pc and
proceed with training Muzikbrowzer. Do not install any software drivers that
may come with Irman.
<p class=text>

<b>USB-UIRT</b> plugs into a usb port. You must 1st install the USB-UIRT Windows
drivers before Muzikbrowzer can communicate with it. 
Follow their instructions
for installing their USB-UIRT and Windows driver.
<p class=text>

<b>Tira</b> plugs into a usb port. You must 1st install the Tira Windows
drivers before Muzikbrowzer can communicate with it.
Follow their instructions
for installing their Tira and Windows driver.
<p class=text>

After you've installed your IR device and any necessary drivers proceed to training Muzikbrowzer with your remote control
in <a href="Configuration.htm#RemoteControl"> Settings/Remote Control</a>.
