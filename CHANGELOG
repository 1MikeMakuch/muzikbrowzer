	renamed to lexer

2005-11-08 19:25  mkm

	BitmapCutter writes BorderPanel into SkinDef.mbsd.  TransColors
	weren't getting read when skin was changed.  Added
	BackgroundPlaylist.bmp, BackgroundAlbumArt.bmp and
	BackgroundLibrary back. They inherit the same background type as
	BackgroundMain.bmp.  Created lexer for reading the SkinDef's.

2005-11-06 18:56  mkm

	BitmapCutter: added; BackgroundType selection, reads
	SkinDefCustom.mbsd and writes to SkinDef.mbsd.

		MB: Now reads SkinDefCustom.mbsd and overlays those
	settings over those read from SkinDef.mbsd, reads BackgroundType,
	eliminated extra redraw after returning from Settings dialog, added
	hidden feature will read SkinDir from Windows Registry and use it
	instead of mbdir/skins.  Added Tiled and Fixed BackgroundMain.bmp
	types, so now there's 3 including stretched.

		Removed "Initial Size" setting from BitmapCutter. Now you
	can do it by setting a parameter on the muzikbrowzer shortcut.
	Right click on the shortcut, Properties, append " -size=800x600" to
	the Target c:\Program Files\muzikbrowzer\muzikbrowzer.exe
	-size=800x600 Set to what ever size you like.

		When all Genre/Artists is selected don't unnecessarily
	repopulate Artists/Albums list when all was already selected.

		Left justify temporary status messages instead of
	centering.  Changed app version to 2.0.0 Eliminated the word
	"Theme" from MB's vernacular.

2005-11-04 00:30  mkm

	Now doing CreateAppMutex to prevent multiple copies from running

2005-11-03 22:22  mkm

	began mods for cvs pserver

2005-11-03 22:17  mkm

	Two days to fix this one: Previous mod to On{Genre|Artist|etc}Focus
	to call OnSelchange{Genre|Artist|etc} to properly update albumart
	when changing focus between library and playlist. That worked but
	it caused a problem with doing tag modification. Due to
	songlib.getSong() behavior where it findsorprepends and due to fact
	that OnUserEdit caused calls to On{Genre|Artist|etc}Focus *before*
	_selected{Genre|Artist|etc} could get updated... it was causing the
	modified tag entry to be added to the songlib in memory. Fixed by
	introducing DBLOCK global.

2005-11-03 00:18  mkm

	Adjust Volume after returning from Pause

2005-11-02 21:03  mkm

	Straightened out Pause/Stop idiosyncracies.  Merged Current Title
	into Status line, lowered time to bottom.  Eliminated 'Press Menu
	for Help' msg.	Auto create 'Most Recent' playlist.  Loading
	Playlist now displays duration.  I think I fixed an old problem
	where once in a while the Column Headers    were not getting
	painted right. Like they'd paint in one color/font/size    then get
	painted over with the correct color/font/size without erasing
	the previous paint. This involved a conflict with CtlColor and
	OnPaint.  Install: Now creates Muzikbrowzer Program Group and puts
	2 shortcuts there 1 for mb and 1 for help.  Playlist reorder
	buttons changed from U and D to AltUp/Down. U and D didn't work if
	there was an entry in the list that started with U or D.

2005-10-26 18:26  mkm
